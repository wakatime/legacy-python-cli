  --local-file FILE     Absolute path to local file for the heartbeat. When
                        --entity is a remote file, this local file will be
                        used for stats and just the value of --entity sent

  --hostname HOSTNAME   Hostname of current machine.
  --disable-offline     Disables offline time logging instead of queuing
                        logged time.
  --hide-file-names     Obfuscate filenames. Will not send file names to api.
  --hide-project-names  Obfuscate project names. When a project folder is
                        detected instead of using the folder name as the
                        project, a .wakatime-project file is created with a
                        random project name.
  --hide-branch-names   Obfuscate branch names. Will not send revision control
                        branch names to api.
  --exclude EXCLUDE     Filename patterns to exclude from logging. POSIX regex
                        syntax. Can be used more than once.

  --include INCLUDE     Filename patterns to log. When used in combination
                        with --exclude, files matching include will still be
                        logged. POSIX regex syntax. Can be used more than
                        once.
  --include-only-with-project-file
                        Disables tracking folders unless they contain a
                        .wakatime-project file. Defaults to false.
  --extra-heartbeats    Reads extra heartbeats from STDIN as a JSON array
                        until EOF.
  --log-file LOG_FILE   Defaults to ~/.wakatime.log.
  --api-url API_URL     Heartbeats api url. For debugging with a local server.
  --timeout TIMEOUT     Number of seconds to wait when sending heartbeats to
                        api. Defaults to 60 seconds.
  --sync-offline-activity SYNC_OFFLINE_ACTIVITY
                        Amount of offline activity to sync from your local
                        ~/.wakatime.db sqlite3 file to your WakaTime Dashboard
                        before exiting. Can be "none" or a positive integer
                        number. Defaults to 5, meaning for every heartbeat
                        sent while online 5 offline heartbeats are synced. Can
                        be used without --entity to only sync offline activity
                        without generating new heartbeats.
  --today               Prints dashboard time for Today, then exits.
  --config CONFIG       Defaults to ~/.wakatime.cfg.
  --verbose             Turns on debug messages in log file.
